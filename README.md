In retrospect, my passion for data science can be reflected in some of my earliest academic experiences. As an avid baseball fan in high school enrolled in AP Computer Science, I attempted to create an MLB game simulation in JavaScript based solely off of player batting averages for my favorite team, the New York Mets, against their archrival at the time, the Washington Nationals.

Unaware of the fact the term “data science” even existed, this “model”—if you can even call it that—ignited a flame in me that grew into a wildfire. 

I heavily pursued my passion for data science while completing my undergraduate degree at NC State. Although majoring in business administration: finance, I had added a statistics minor, and also enrolled in the Business Analytics Honors Program. I would later become an undergraduate teaching assistant in the BAHP at NC State’s Poole College of Management. 

I was so eager to learn more content that I decided that pursuing data science at one university wasn’t enough, and gave up my Monday and Wednesday nights and Saturday afternoons to complete The Data Analytics Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill my junior year of college. 

Throughout these experiences, I had learned and taught exploratory data analysis, the ins and outs of several types of predictive models, multiple coding languages such as Python, R, SAS, and SQL, and much more. 

Applying the skills I had learned in these programs at my internship as an actuarial analyst with Blue Cross Blue Shield NC the following summer reinforced my decision that I wanted to be a data scientist. Interpreting, analyzing, and visualizing pharmaceutical and unpaid claim data allowed me to put my new found skills to practice in a real world setting. 

Outside of the hours currently required to pursue a M.S. in Analytics with personal projects on the side, I enjoy working out, playing intramural sand volleyball with my friends, and watching baseball (did I mention that?).
