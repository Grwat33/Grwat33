Hi! I'm Garrett Watkins, a current undergraduate student at North Carolina State University graduating in May 2022. I have aspirations of becoming a data scientist or analyst, and have a passion for coding and statistical analysis. I will be pursing my Master's of Analytics in the Class of 2023 at the Institute for Advanced Analytics at NC State University starting in June.
